	<div id="splasher"> Philadelphia abounds with historical buildings. Construction dates may pale in comparison to Byblos or Athens, but in the context of the United States, the city’s structures are among the longest standing. 
	Philadelphia claims the country’s oldest continuously inhabited street, its most historic square mile, and the title of America’s only UNESCO World Heritage City. 
	These old buildings matter, and not just the most well known sites like Independence Hall that function as national emblems and magnets for the tourists that inject millions of dollars into the city’s economy each year.   
	</br>
	This project will explore the spatial distribution of Philadelphia’s historical building stock.
	</br>
These two maps present a temporal visualization of Philadelphia’s urban development that adds a holistic framework to the disparate narratives of the individual structures. 
	</br>
Why have some areas retained old buildings while others have been redeveloped?
	</br>
Does a building or neighborhood’s location influence its chances of longevity?
